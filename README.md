# Factions: At War

**_Factions: At War_** is a TPS multiplayer game similar to Battlefield Heroes. I am developing the project in my free time to understand multiplayer game design, multiplayer server architectures and networking concepts. I am using Unity game engine for both the client side and the server side. 

I am not going to share the code for the game. I will use this repository to incldue gameplay videos, screenshots and for any miscellaneous event. This documentation will be updated once a certain milestone is reached.

## Goals:

* Finish the project by the end of the spring semester.

## Things I gained familiarity with:

### Animations (Unity Animation System)

*  Multiple animator layers for blending in multiple animations such as throwing a grenade while running.

### Multiplayer Development
